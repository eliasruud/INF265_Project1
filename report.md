# Project report

The report should consist of two parts (in the same pdf):

1. An explanation of your approach and design choices to help us understand how your particular
implementation works.










###########################
2. Answers to the following questions:

(a) Which PyTorch method(s) correspond to the tasks described in section 2?


(b) Cite a method used to check whether the computed gradient of a function seems correct.
Briefly explain how you would use this method to check your computed gradients in
section 2.


(c) Which PyTorch method(s) correspond to the tasks described in section 3, question 4.?


(d) Briefly explain the purpose of adding momentum to the gradient descent algorithm.


(e) Briefly explain the purpose of adding regularization to the gradient descent algorithm.


(f) Report the different parameters used in section 3, question 8., the selected parameters in


(g) Comment your results. In case you do not get expected results, try to give potential
reasons that would explain why your code does not work and/or your results differ.





CHECKLIST:

Report
Comments on your approach and design choices include (but are not limited to):
- What was your approach to analyse the data you were given? Why? Are there any challenges that you should take into account with this dataset?
- Do all your preprocessing steps / sanity checks / performance measure / model architectures / different sets of hyperparameters tried, etc. match the data and the task you were given? Justify.
- Have you tried other approaches that were not successful and therefore not used in the final pipeline? Do you know what went wrong? Otherwise, what would be your best explanation? Have
    you attached the code of these failed attempts in your code?
- What was your approach to analyse your results? Why?

Comments on your implementation include (but are not limited to):
- Which libraries did you use (pandas? numpy? sklearn? bare lists/dictionaries? etc.)? Are they relevant for the data and the tasks you were given? Why?
- What type of programming did you use and why? (Object-oriented programming? Recursion? Splitthe problem into smaller functions?)
- Is your implementation efficient and "pythonic"?
- Did you feel limited by your programming skills? If so, why?

Reporting results
- Does the selected model along with its performance appear clearly and distinctly in your report?
    They should not be hidden somewhere in the middle of a paragraph.
- For each performance reported, have you clearly specified the metric used and on which dataset?
    (And have you specified how you split your dataset in the first place?)

Comments on your results include (but are not limited to):
- Does the selected model seem to underfit/overfit?
- Are your results surprising? In other words, relative to your general knowledge in machine learning, your understanding of the data and the problem, 
    and relative to the confidence you put in your design choices and implementation, did you expect such performance?
- Are your results satisfying? In other words, is your model better than random outputs? Does your model outperform any baseline model? 
    Do you think you could use your model in real life? If so, in which conditions?
- In which cases does your selected model seem to struggle? In which cases does your model seem to yield good results? How would you explain that?
- If you were given unlimited time, what would you try to improve your performance?
- Does the code run slower/faster than what you would expect? If so, what would be your best guess to explain why?

Figures
- Are there any relevant figures in your report? (E.g. about the data, your results, etc.)
- Are they correctly annotated? (E.g., title, axis labels, legend, etc. Are fonts large enough to be read easily? 
    Do we know precisely on which dataset your figures were generated?)
- Do you explain what can be concluded from the figures?

Clarity of the report
- Is your report well structured or is it one big paragraph?
- Can the reader fully understand your report without having opened your code files beforehand?
- Can the reader find quickly the piece of information they wanted or is it necessary to read it through?
- Are you sure all snippets of code you have included in your report (if you have put any) are relevant in a report?
